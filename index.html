				<p>
					Hello, I am Rabbi from Montreal, Canada originally from Dhaka,
					Bangladesh. My first job was working in a Mexican restaurant as a bus
					boy. My favorite part of that job was getting quality free foods. Also
					I learned a lot about how a restaurant business works. Since I was a
					student at that time, I found the job very physically demanding and
					couldnâ€™t concentrate on my study after work. So, I moved on to a
					Customer Service job where I was working as a collection agent for a
					telecommunication company. After my graduation, I found it difficult
					to get a job in my discipline. So, I kept working for variety of
					companies in Technical Support and Customer Service positions. After a
					while I decided to switch my career and joined General Assembly
					Software Engineering Immersive program.
